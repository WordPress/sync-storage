// setting). Both carry the same conventional prefix, so both become changelog
// entries. This is a known release-please bug, googleapis/release-please#2476,
// and it has no fix and no config switch. Upstream's own workarounds are to
// squash-merge, which would cost contributors their git attribution, or to
// flip that repository setting, which needs admin. Neither is available here,
// so the duplicates get removed after the fact instead.
//
// Runs over CHANGELOG.md on the release pull request branch, from the
// sync-versions job in release-please.yml. Commit 921d838 is the same edit
// done by hand. The GitHub Release body is generated separately and keeps its
// duplicates; CHANGELOG.md is the canonical record, and WordPress.org reads
// readme.txt, so neither depends on that body.
